# I'm Bohdan, front-end developer based in Ukraine

Greetings everyoneðŸ‘‹! My hobby and occupation is developing websites using ReactJS. Challenging projects with user-friendly designs and plenty of logic behind them motivate me to learn even more, so I'm ready to manage stressful moments of the development process.
Here's a list of technologies that I use:
  - HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Tailwind
  - Pure Javascript, ReactJS library
  - Component libraries
